# Image-Coloristion
Night vision camera provides greyscale and negative equivalent images. Looking at a grayscale picture as input, we aim to attack the problem of hallucinating an appreciable color version of a picture. 

Previous approaches have either relied on significant user interactions or resulting in desaturated colorifications.

I proposed a fully automated approach that produces vibrant and realistic  colors. 

The system is implemented as a feed-forwardpass to CNN at the time of testing and trained. Furthermore, we point out that by acting as a crosschannel encoder, colorization can be a powerful excuse for self-supervised feature learning.
