# Image-Coloristion
Night vision camera provides greyscale and negative equivalent images. Looking at a grayscale picture as input, we aim to attack the problem of hallucinating an appreciable color version of a picture. 

Previous approaches have either relied on significant user interactions or resulting in desaturated colorifications.

We propose a fully automated approach that produces vibrant and realistic  colors. 

The system is implemented as a feed-forwardpass to CNN at the time of testing and trained. Furthermore, we point out that by acting as a crosschannel encoder, colorization can be a powerful excuse for self-supervised feature learning![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47251623/117767543-b3488680-b24e-11eb-8280-87ee2294a99b.png)
